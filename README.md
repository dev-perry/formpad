# Formpad

Formpad converts YAML into HTML web forms. This project was inspired by [GitHub's form schema](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-githubs-form-schema).

This is a portfolio project by [Perry Asibey-Bonsu](https://linkedin.com/in/pasibey)
